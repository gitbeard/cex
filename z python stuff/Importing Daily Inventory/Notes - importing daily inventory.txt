These are the files for importing the daily inventory Chris sends out, into the database for the rails website.

This uses excel python tools xlutils which needs to be installed.

Overview of operation:
Files go in the RAW folder.
The file info gets inserted into the file_infos table.
The file get's openned in excel, and the CA_INV or NC_INV tab gets selected, and put into a new .csv file formatted for inserting into the database.
The new .csv file is located in DATA\OUTPUT.
The .csv file then gets imported into the database.
Currently the .csv file is being moved into the Done folder, but it needs to automatically move into the CA or NC folder.

When you import CA_INV, the location_id should be 1 in the make_inv_record function, and the ws_ind = ws_names["NC INV"] in the main function.
When you import NC_INV, the location_id should be 2, and the ws_ind = ws_names["NC INV"]
